I'm writing an article for this code. I uploaded it here as: 12/6/24 Raspberry Pi Pico W Wifi a Word .docx file. This is actually a living document in Google Docs, but I don't know yet how to link that here. Later maybe?
I recommend starting with the code dated 120624 since that is the simplest way to start. The more complex code works but there were many problems at first and may well still have some.
